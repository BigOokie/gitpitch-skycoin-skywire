## What is Skywire?

- Skywire is Skycoinâ€™s peer-to-peer distributed global mesh network
- Skywire consists of thousands of hardware nodes that can communicate
over almost any type of wired or wireless transmission media
- Nodes earn cryptocurrency, which is paid by the users of the network, thus financially incentivizing the deployment of nodes
- Skywire is ISP-independent and free from government control
- Private, anonymous, encrypted, decentralized and uncensorable
- Cheaper and faster than traditional ISPs, using efficient MPLS routing
- Skywire hardware (nodes and antennas) can be built at minimal cost using commonly available components
- Low energy requirements (nodes can run indefinitely on solar power)
